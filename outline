Normalize data
- [0,1]
- median

PCA - for visualization (or even for clustering)
- visualized the data via PCA in two dimensions

Exploring Feature-space
- more features?
- weighting them differently
- categories
- price

Statistical Evaluation of the features themselves
- which help differentiate
- whcih don't seem to.


Understanding/Analyzing the performance of our current results
- show that there's no meaningful trend over the number of clusters?
- total sumd vs. k


try other algorithms
- k nearest neighbors




Outline of Paper/Milestone:


Got data from 3taps
- highlight features used

What did we do with data?
- performed initial kmeans clustering on metadata
  - normalize
  - PCA
- compare with initial other algorithm??? clustering

Qualitative Analysis of results
- not that great
- doesn't appear to be convergence => vectors are not naturally clustered (separately)

Statistical Analysis on results?
- can we plot total sumd vs. k

Future work
- explore feature space
