Contracts to Teach in China 
Thank you for inquiring about teaching in China  We understand that traveling to a foreign country to teach can be a very difficult decision Trying to find the right contract to teach in China can be quite challenging Many schools in China have unfair business practices and offer unfair contracts It is hard to know who to trust  We are an American organization that is designed to protect the rights of Americans that want to teach in China Our top concern is that people sign a fair contract to teach at a safe and legal school in China We negotiate contracts nationwide at all age levels including university The process of finding a legitimate position in China can be difficult and stressful Our goal is to make the process of gaining employment in China as simple as possible  MUST READ To help save time we have added some answers to Frequently Asked Questions These answers are standard for REAL schools in China  How long are the contracts  A standard contract is two semesters Fall Spring The duration of the contracts are 10 months long which includes two months vacation The start dates are September 1st and March 1st  What is the pay  The average pay of a standard contract is 4000RMB6000RMB a month for teaching 1620 hours a week Every teacher also receives a free private fully furnished apartment  The contracts are designed with low working hours so people will enjoy the experience When contracts start to exceed 20 hours per week the stress of the position increases exponentially In China your fellow Chinese teachers will make around 2000RMB for teaching 40 hours a week They usually room with three other teachers Another thing to note is that living in China is very inexpensive  Who pays for the Flight  All schools reimburse the flight after the completion of the contract Anyone who wishes to teach in China must initially have the funds for a one way ticket to China  Is there health insurance  Schools offer basic health insurance that covers things like doctors visits and simple medications  What will I teach  In most situations your position would be to teach simple English conversation The interacting with students is what is most important to the school Schools want their students to have exposure speaking English with foreigners      Location Nationwide   Compensation see post   This is a contract job  Principals only Recruiters please dont contact this job poster  Please no phone calls about this job  Please do not contact job poster about other services products or commercial interests    PostingID3410134910     Copyright copy 2012 craigslist inc  terms of use  privacy policy  feedback forum
