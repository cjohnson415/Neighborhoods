Hello I am in need of an ongoing digital photographer I have just moved to the area and need help taking photos of my recipes    You can take a look at more of the existing photography at wwwDJFoodiecom  The idea is to take attractive photos of actual food in very simple environments Food should take center stage As should be fairly obvious    the photography thus far has not been award winning but it does showcase the actual recipes My goal is to match or improve the level of quality while still staying within my budget of 40000 per month    I imagine Im looking for a budding photography student an amateur photographer or someone with a camera who is interested in the low carb lifestyle The work is about 2 to 3 hours twice a week Approximately 5 hours per week Its a VERY casual and relaxed environment Its me cooking while you take a photo I cook 8 recipes per session While you are shooting one I am lining up the next recipe We go through this process 8 times then    shut it down We meet again later in the week    My previous photographer would take the photos then return to his home and select his favorites Each recipe has 3 photos roughly a stock shot a close up and an artsy one     Each of those is optimized for the web and given back to me including every raw photo taken at the next shoot So there is a bit of homework and Photoshop work that may also be involved but that should be quick    The pay is 400 cash per month It includes a lot of delicious food you will stuff yourself at most all photo shoots  Depending on the menu you are also likely to take food home bring Tupperware  A solid budgetfriendly photographer with a good camera lights some basic Photoshoping skills and a desire to eat and learn more about low carb would be perfect     My schedule is flexible Im willing to work around your schedule within some degree of accuracy The shoots do need to be in the late afternoon or evening simply because I need to prepare and cook in the morningearly afternoon My previous shoots were Mondays and Thursdays but we could shoot on SaturdaySunday or    any other two days of the week We would meet at 3 PM and shoot until done This could be pushed to later in the evening Sometimes its 45 minutes and others    4 hours It depends on the menu and circumstances but its usually about 2 hours Im located in Belltown Free parking in the garage    If youre interested shoot me an email with your contact info some thoughts and a portfolio if you have one    if not just let me know why youre right for the job  Thats it I hope to hear from you Thanks DJ     Location Belltown  its NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests   Compensation 400 per month     PostingID3410143483     Copyright copy 2012 craigslist inc  terms of use  privacy policy  feedback forum  ,2.7608107240474636E-5,8.909641801766616E-6,3.5973006306312544E-5,1.6256064642940897E-5,1.5132421026443429E-5,5.2735363651582225E-5,3.828503873978558E-5,1.4150566235926978E-4,2.656828382022793E-5,5.0083737329374024E-5,2.5943064311877772E-5,2.6514898474261767E-5,3.4904553020098394E-5,1.6963512665417354E-5,5.9579231699695596E-5,1.426672034880877E-5,7.287795557607858E-5,4.260768304606583E-5,4.896983879364383E-5,2.259999168094615E-5,1.5381578996254103E-5,4.0393621791683284E-5,3.425761163249349E-5,2.8348200015554172E-5,1.2658801313109116E-5,2.71872950676565E-5,4.317193312757855E-5,1.1380635628643547E-4,0.9988855211041134,2.098872112065655E-5

Hello I am in need of an ongoing digital photographer I have just moved to the area and need help taking photos of my recipes    You can take a look at more of the existing photography at wwwDJFoodiecom  The idea is to take attractive photos of actual food in very simple environments Food should take center stage As should be fairly obvious    the photography thus far has not been award winning but it does showcase the actual recipes My goal is to match or improve the level of quality while still staying within my budget of 40000 per month    I imagine Im looking for a budding photography student an amateur photographer or someone with a camera who is interested in the low carb lifestyle The work is about 2 to 3 hours twice a week Approximately 5 hours per week Its a VERY casual and relaxed environment Its me cooking while you take a photo I cook 8 recipes per session While you are shooting one I am lining up the next recipe We go through this process 8 times then    shut it down We meet again later in the week    My previous photographer would take the photos then return to his home and select his favorites Each recipe has 3 photos roughly a stock shot a close up and an artsy one     Each of those is optimized for the web and given back to me including every raw photo taken at the next shoot So there is a bit of homework and Photoshop work that may also be involved but that should be quick    The pay is 400 cash per month It includes a lot of delicious food you will stuff yourself at most all photo shoots  Depending on the menu you are also likely to take food home bring Tupperware  A solid budgetfriendly photographer with a good camera lights some basic Photoshoping skills and a desire to eat and learn more about low carb would be perfect     My schedule is flexible Im willing to work around your schedule within some degree of accuracy The shoots do need to be in the late afternoon or evening simply because I need to prepare and cook in the morningearly afternoon My previous shoots were Mondays and Thursdays but we could shoot on SaturdaySunday or    any other two days of the week We would meet at 3 PM and shoot until done This could be pushed to later in the evening Sometimes its 45 minutes and others    4 hours It depends on the menu and circumstances but its usually about 2 hours Im located in Belltown Free parking in the garage    If youre interested shoot me an email with your contact info some thoughts and a portfolio if you have one    if not just let me know why youre right for the job  Thats it I hope to hear from you Thanks DJ     Location Belltown  its NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests   Compensation 400 per month     PostingID3410143483     Copyright copy 2012 craigslist inc  terms of use  privacy policy  feedback forum  ,2.7608107240474636E-5,8.909641801766616E-6,3.5973006306312544E-5,1.6256064642940897E-5,1.5132421026443429E-5,5.2735363651582225E-5,3.828503873978558E-5,1.4150566235926978E-4,2.656828382022793E-5,5.0083737329374024E-5,2.5943064311877772E-5,2.6514898474261767E-5,3.4904553020098394E-5,1.6963512665417354E-5,5.9579231699695596E-5,1.426672034880877E-5,7.287795557607858E-5,4.260768304606583E-5,4.896983879364383E-5,2.259999168094615E-5,1.5381578996254103E-5,4.0393621791683284E-5,3.425761163249349E-5,2.8348200015554172E-5,1.2658801313109116E-5,2.71872950676565E-5,4.317193312757855E-5,1.1380635628643547E-4,0.9988855211041134,2.098872112065655E-5

Thank you for inquiring about teaching in China  We understand that traveling to a foreign country to teach can be a very difficult decision Trying to find the right contract to teach in China can be quite challenging Many schools in China have unfair business practices and offer unfair contracts It is hard to know who to trust  We are an American organization that is designed to protect the rights of Americans that want to teach in China Our top concern is that people sign a fair contract to teach at a safe and legal school in China We negotiate contracts nationwide at all age levels including university The process of finding a legitimate position in China can be difficult and stressful Our goal is to make the process of gaining employment in China as simple as possible  MUST READ To help save time we have added some answers to Frequently Asked Questions These answers are standard for REAL schools in China  How long are the contracts  A standard contract is two semesters Fall Spring The duration of the contracts are 10 months long which includes two months vacation The start dates are September 1st and March 1st  What is the pay  The average pay of a standard contract is 4000RMB6000RMB a month for teaching 1620 hours a week Every teacher also receives a free private fully furnished apartment  The contracts are designed with low working hours so people will enjoy the experience When contracts start to exceed 20 hours per week the stress of the position increases exponentially In China your fellow Chinese teachers will make around 2000RMB for teaching 40 hours a week They usually room with three other teachers Another thing to note is that living in China is very inexpensive  Who pays for the Flight  All schools reimburse the flight after the completion of the contract Anyone who wishes to teach in China must initially have the funds for a one way ticket to China  Is there health insurance  Schools offer basic health insurance that covers things like doctors visits and simple medications  What will I teach  In most situations your position would be to teach simple English conversation The interacting with students is what is most important to the school Schools want their students to have exposure speaking English with foreigners      Location Nationwide   Compensation see post   This is a contract job  Principals only Recruiters please dont contact this job poster  Please no phone calls about this job  Please do not contact job poster about other services products or commercial interests    PostingID3410134910     Copyright copy 2012 craigslist inc  terms of use  privacy policy  feedback forum  ,1.588634101723047E-4,9.4607524344371E-5,0.05235042128805832,5.539024601430544E-5,9.603707095146881E-5,0.030766021574728204,1.089033743767699E-4,9.542803407016273E-5,2.0408435643669938E-4,3.485424325379258E-5,1.930890721898068E-4,5.358057824033898E-5,1.0146689379336001E-4,4.788659666553996E-5,1.3241248933930247E-4,5.889554899908874E-5,6.41169549385257E-5,7.555048362723608E-5,9.19165659219716E-5,1.1884169472769132E-4,1.5292095242227383E-4,2.552730426348217E-4,5.011276485513203E-5,0.09777048514750553,9.826949665793795E-5,2.2955656155178937E-4,0.12316099941650566,0.5383377279279316,0.08655826185886918,0.06848402483021687
