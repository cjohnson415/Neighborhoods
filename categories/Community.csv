USA-GES-AND, imperfect pet owner seeking perfect adopter I wanted a pet so I got one But I am tired of taking care of it and paying for it I might even be moving in which case I would have to pay a pet deposit or spend an extra 30 seconds planning how to take along my pet Maybe I decided to have a baby or get a boyfriend or girlfriend Anyhow I dont want my pet anymore Oh wait that sounds every bit as selfish as I am I mean I cant keep my pet Yeah thats it Oh allergies YES I suddenly got allergies No one will question that  Now about my pet Ive had it since it was a kitten or pup or egg if reptilian and now its middle aged the age NO ONE wants to adopt but didnt you see I need someone to take care of it  Anyhow since this process will be very upsetting for my formerly precious pet and because I may feel an inkling of guilt I want the adopter to give it a home where there are no other pets so it doesnt have to share your affections even though Ive been ignoring it for months Now let me tell you how sweet lovable and darling heshe is Also allow me to fail to mention that heshe has a urination issue when scared or heshe eat sofas etc  Oh and I think you should pay a fee to show youre capable of buying cat food And plus I spent money on it 8 years ago and heck I can get a few boxes of diapers for the baby with that cash  Besides everyone knows that you can tell a person whos taking your pet to be a test lab subject by whether or not theyll shell out 50 If my pet is purebred I will likely try to charge you hundreds Because I spend hundreds and this is a very valuable pet I just dont want it anymore But YOU should want it enough to help me recoup my original purchase price  Now I hope youll take it right to the vet because heshe is behind on shots And was never spayedneutered And make sure it gets premium food and all the things it deserves but I am too selfish to even continue to care for it And remember this is a commitment you better not take it and then change your mind ever because only I can do that Now that I dumped himher on you heshe is too traumatized to ever face that again  Last of all I will now close by telling you that I need this person who takes over my responsibility to come along quickly because otherwise I may have to take himher to the pound I probably wont but that threat is sure to scare someone into hurrying up and taking over my responsibility    its NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests    PostingID3410160041    No contact info   if the poster didnt include a phone number email or other contact info craigslist can notify them via email           Copyright copy 2012 craigslist inc  terms of use  privacy policy  feedback forum    Dog TrainingBoarding  Affordable dog training we offer  Group Classes Private Lessons BoardingTraining InHome  Our expert trainer uses kind and postive methods  We have limited space left for Boarding over Thanksgiving our rates start at 15 and up to 25 depending on the size of your pet All inclusive  Call now 8644300712   sithappensdogtrainingcom
